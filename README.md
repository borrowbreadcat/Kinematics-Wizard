# Kinematics-Wizard

STICKY
A program that solves newtonian kinematics algebra problems automatically. Things like initial velocity, how long is it falling, how far did it travel, etc.

I have written the program up to a working version.  It should be available to download off of this site.  

I made a lot of programming no-nos along the way, and the product still has a major issue involved with rounding floating point variables.

In the Chapter 2 comprehensive quiz on learncpp.com, i was asked to write a program that tracks the position of a ball in free fall, given it's initial altitude. It was very satisfying to write and add an improvement or two, and it brought back memories of when I taught algebra based physics to 9th graders. 

It got me thinking that I might, even at this moment, have enough c++ skills to write a more comprehensive program which could calculate algebraic kinematics automatically.  It would ask the user a series of questions about the situation, filling in values and determining what variables are unknown. Then it would provide a list of all the values it can figure out, noting which ones were solved and which were given. It could perhaps then answer other more specific questions like "where was the ball at this given time" or stuff like that. 

It is a bit intimidating, but I think I can do this.
